    review: 'Shaan, one of the best coach around. He not only trains you physically but mentally too. He shares his own personal experience/failures and how he overcame them. He gives you personal attention, helps you work on your skills, gives you personalised improvement techniques too. Highly recommended if you are looking for cricket coaching, not only for kids, but adults too.',

    review: 'I love that the coach at this accademy focuses on technique and fun equally. At grass root level if the emphasis of a coach is too much on the technique then the kids in the age group of 5-12 quickly loose interest in going to the academy. The drop out rate is higher on this age group. At limitLess cricket academy, Shaan ensures that each kid goes back with a smile on his face. He has a day wise plan chalked out which is a combination of fitness, skills and enjoyment while learning. Plenty of match simulation and practice match opportunities for all age groups. Special sessions with guest trainers certified from Mumbai Cricket Association.',
